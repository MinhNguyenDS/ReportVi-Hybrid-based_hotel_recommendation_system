It produces easily explainable and interpretable recommendations and handles \"cold item\" and \"semi-cold user\" scenarios. SAR is a kind of neighborhood based algorithm (as discussed in [Recommender Systems by Aggarwal](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2931100)) which is intended for ranking top items for each user. More details about SAR can be found in the [deep dive notebook](../02_model_collaborative_filtering/sar_deep_dive.ipynb).\n","\n","SAR recommends items that are most ***similar*** to the ones that the user already has an existing ***affinity*** for. Two items are ***similar*** if the users that interacted with one item are also likely to have interacted with the other. A user has an ***affinity*** to an item if they have interacted with it in the past.\n","\n","### Advantages of SAR:\n","- High accuracy for an easy to train and deploy algorithm\n","- Fast training, only requiring simple counting to construct matrices used at prediction time.\n","- Fast scoring, only involving multiplication of the similarity matrix with an affinity vector\n","\n","### Notes to use SAR properly:\n","- Since it does not use item or user features, it can be at a disadvantage against algorithms that do.\n","- It's memory-hungry, requiring the creation of an $mxm$ sparse square matrix (where $m$ is the number of items). This can also be a problem for many matrix factorization algorithms.\n","- SAR favors an implicit rating scenario and it does not predict ratings.\n","\n","This notebook provides an example of how to utilize and evaluate SAR in Python on a CPU."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import
