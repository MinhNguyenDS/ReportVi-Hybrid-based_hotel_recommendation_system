Currently, we can support NextItNet \\[4\\], GRU \\[2\\], Caser \\[3\\], A2SVD \\[1\\], SLi_Rec \\[1\\], and SUM \\[5\\]. Without loss of generality, this notebook takes [SLi_Rec model](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/07/IJCAI19-ready_v1.pdf) for example.\n","SLi_Rec \\[1\\] is a deep learning-based model aims at capturing both long and short-term user preferences for precise recommender systems. To summarize, SLi_Rec has the following key properties:\n","\n","* It adopts the attentive \"Asymmetric-SVD\" paradigm for long-term modeling;\n","* It takes both time irregularity and semantic irregularity into consideration by modifying the gating logic in LSTM.\n","* It uses an attention mechanism to dynamic fuse the long-term component and short-term component.\n","\n","In this notebook, we test SLi_Rec on a subset of the public dataset: [Amazon_reviews](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon/productGraph/categoryFiles/reviews_Movies_and_TV_5.json.gz) and [Amazon_metadata](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon/productGraph/categoryFiles/meta_Movies_and_TV.json.gz)\n","\n","This notebook is tested under TF 2.6."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"91MqlxTHlznD"},"source":["## 0.

And you need to tell the input iterator where is the ID mapping files are. (For example, in the next section, we have some mapping files like user_vocab, item_vocab, and cate_vocab).  The data preprocessing script is at [recommenders/dataset/amazon_reviews.py](../../recommenders/dataset/amazon_reviews.py), you need to call the `_create_vocab(train_file, user_vocab, item_vocab, cate_vocab)` function. Note that ID vocabulary only creates from the train_file, so the new IDs in valid_file or test_file will be regarded as unknown IDs and assigned with a defualt 0 index.\n","\n","Only the SLi_Rec model is time-aware. For the other models, you can just pad some meaningless timestamp in the data files to fill up the format, the models will ignore these columns.\n","\n","We use Softmax to the loss function. In training and evalution stage, we group 1 positive instance with `num_ngs` negative instances. Pair-wise ranking can be regarded as a special case of softmax ranking, where `num_ngs` is set to 1.\n","\n","More specifically, for training and evalation, you need to organize the data file such that each one positive instance is followed by `num_ngs` negative instances. Our program will take `1+num_ngs` lines as a unit for Softmax calculation. `num_ngs` is a parameter you need to pass to the `prepare_hparams`, `fit` and `run_eval` function. `train_num_ngs` in `prepare_hparams` denotes the number of negative instances for training, where a recommended number is 4. `valid_num_ngs` and `num_ngs` in `fit` and `run_eval` denote the number in evalution. In evaluation, the model calculates metrics among the `1+num_ngs` instances. For the `predict` function, since we only need to calcuate a score for each individual instance, there is no need for `num_ngs` setting.  More details and examples will be provided in the following sections.\n","\n","For training stage, if you don't want to prepare negative instances, you can just provide positive instances and set the parameter `need_sample=True, train_num_ngs=train_num_ngs` for function `prepare_hparams`, our model will dynamicly sample `train_num_ngs` instances as negative samples in each mini batch.\n","\n","###  Amazon dataset\n","Now let's start with a public dataset containing product reviews and metadata from Amazon, which is widely used as a benchmark dataset in recommemdation systems field."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data_path"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"id":"iluZ6xGasnDo","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1702461214656,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":353,"user":{"displayName":"Minh Nguyễn Hoàng","userId":"04529726266143512473"}},"outputId":"4e142312-e685-43da-9646-bf3483695fbf"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'../../tests/resources/deeprec/slirec'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":18}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"scrolled":false,"id":"02ytxLJRlznK"},"outputs":[],"source":["# for test\n","train_file = os.path.join(data_path, r'train_data')\n","valid_file = os.path.join(data_path, r'valid_data')\n","test_file = os.path.join(data_path, r'test_data')\n","user_vocab = os.path.join(data_path, r'user_vocab.pkl')\n","item_vocab = os.path.join(data_path, r'item_vocab.pkl')\n","cate_vocab = os.path.join(data_path, r'category_vocab.pkl')\n","output_file = os.path.join(data_path, r'output.txt')\n","\n","reviews_name = 'reviews_Movies_and_TV_5.json'\n","meta_name = 'meta_Movies_and_TV.json'\n","reviews_file = os.path.join(data_path, reviews_name)\n","meta_file = os.path.join(data_path, meta_name)\n","train_num_ngs = 4 # number of negative instances with a positive instance for training\n","valid_num_ngs = 4 # number of negative instances with a positive instance for validation\n","test_num_ngs = 9 # number of negative instances with a positive instance for testing\n","sample_rate = 0.01 # sample a small item set for training and testing here for fast example\n","\n","input_files = [reviews_file, meta_file, train_file, valid_file, test_file, user_vocab, item_vocab, cate_vocab]\n","\n","if not os.path.exists(train_file):\n","    download_and_extract(reviews_name, reviews_file)\n","    download_and_extract(meta_name, meta_file)\n","    data_preprocessing(*input_files, sample_rate=sample_rate, valid_num_ngs=valid_num_ngs, test_num_ngs=test_num_ngs)\n","    #### uncomment this for the NextItNet model, because it does not need to unfold the user history\n","    # data_preprocessing(*input_files, sample_rate=sample_rate, valid_num_ngs=valid_num_ngs, test_num_ngs=test_num_ngs, is_history_expanding=False)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kjs7J3-5lznL"},"source":["#### 1.1 Prepare hyper-parameters\n","prepare_hparams() will create a full set of hyper-parameters for model training, such as learning rate, feature number, and dropout ratio.
