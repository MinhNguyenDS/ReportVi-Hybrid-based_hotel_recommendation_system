This is very common in scenarios where recommender systems are based on implicit user behavior (e.g. purchases, clicks). The available observations are only positive feedback where the non-observed ones are a mixture of real negative feedback and missing values.\n","\n","One usual approach for item recommendation is directly predicting a preference score $\\hat{x}_{u,i}$ given to item $i$ by user $u$. This method uses the **pointwise loss** to optimize the model. Methods based on pointwise learning usually follow a regression framework by minimizing the  squared loss between $\\hat{x}_{u,i}$ its target value ${x}_{u,i}$. Unfortunately, this method doesn't work well with ranking.\n","\n","<p align=\"center\">\n","<img src=\"https://recodatasets.z20.web.core.windows.net/images/bpr1.png\" width=\"400px\">\n","</p>\n","\n","In the implicit feedback scenario the observed data is positive feedback. As it is shown in the figure above, the observed data (image to the left) is known, but the unobserved data is unknown. The negative data is usually generated by filling the matrix with 0 (image to the right).\n","\n","Using the pointwise loss, the model is trained to predict as 1 the elements in the observed dataset and 0 for the rest. The problem with this approach is that all elements the model should rank in the future are presented as negative feedback during training but in reality, some of them are unknown items and some of them are true negatives.\n","\n","BPR uses a different approach by using item pairs $(i, j)$ and optimizing for the correct ranking given preference of user $u$, thus, there are notions of *positive* and *negative* items. The training data $D_S : U \\times I \\times I$ is defined as:\n","\n","$$D_S = \\{(u, i, j) \\mid i \\in I^{+}_{u} \\wedge j \\in I \\setminus I^{+}_{u}\\}$$\n","\n","where user $u$ is assumed to prefer $i$ over $j$ (i.e. $i$ is a *positive item* and $j$ is a *negative item*).\n","\n","This approach uses the **pairwise loss**. The intuition behind it is that observed entries should be ranked higher than the unobserved ones. Then instead of minimizing the loss between $\\hat{x}_{u,i}$ and ${x}_{u,i}$, pairwise learning maximizes the margin between the observed entry $\\hat{x}_{u,i}$ and the unobserved entry $\\hat{x}_{u,j}$.\n","\n","<p align=\"center\">\n","<img src=\"https://recodatasets.z20.web.core.windows.net/images/bpr2.png\" width=\"400px\">\n","</p>\n","\n","In the figure above, pairwise learning is explained. For each user, a pairwise matrix of items is generated. The plus indicates that the user prefers item *i* over item *j*, and the minus is that the user prefers item *j* over *i*. The interrogation indicates that we don't know the user's preference.\n","\n","The pairwise setup has several advantages:\n","* The training set is defined as positive, negative and unknown preferences.\n","* The missing values between two non-observed items are exactly the item pairs that have to be ranked by the model.\n","* The training data is created for the actual objective of ranking.\n","* Pairwise ranking is not restricted to implicit feedback and can be used in explicit feedback by setting user preferences as pairs (i.e. user *u* prefers item *a* more than item *b*).\n","\n","### 1.2 Pairwise Objective Function\n","\n","From the Bayesian perspective, BPR maximizes the posterior probability over the model parameters $\\Theta$ by optimizing the likelihood function $p(i >_{u} j | \\Theta)$ and the prior probability $p(\\Theta)$.\n","\n","$$p(\\Theta \\mid >_{u}) \\propto p(i >_{u} j \\mid \\Theta) \\times p(\\Theta)$$\n","\n","The joint probability of the likelihood over all users $u \\in U$ can be simplified to:\n","\n","$$ \\prod_{u \\in U} p(>_{u} \\mid \\Theta) = \\prod_{(u, i, j) \\in D_S} p(i >_{u} j \\mid \\Theta) $$\n","\n","The individual probability that a user $u$ prefers item $i$ to item $j$ can be defined as:\n","\n","$$ p(i >_{u} j \\mid \\Theta) = \\sigma (\\hat{x}_{uij}(\\Theta)) $$\n","\n","where $\\sigma$ is the logistic sigmoid:\n","\n","$$ \\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} $$\n","\n","The preference scoring function $\\hat{x}_{uij}(\\Theta)$ could be an arbitrary real-valued function of the model parameter $\\Theta$.  Thus, it makes BPR a general framework for modeling the relationship between triplets $(u, i, j)$ where different model classes like matrix factorization could be used for estimating $\\hat{x}_{uij}(\\Theta)$.\n","\n","For the prior, one of the common pratices is to choose $p(\\Theta)$ following a normal distribution, which results in a nice form of L2 regularization in the final log-form of the objective function.\n","\n","$$ p(\\Theta) \\sim N(0, \\Sigma_{\\Theta}) $$\n","\n","To reduce the complexity of the model, all parameters $\\Theta$ are assumed to be independent and having the same variance, which gives a simpler form of the co-variance matrix $\\Sigma_{\\Theta} = \\lambda_{\\Theta}I$.  Thus, there are less number of hyperparameters to be determined.\n","\n","The final objective of the maximum posterior estimator:\n","\n","$$ J = \\sum_{(u, i, j) \\in D_S} \\text{ln } \\sigma(\\hat{x}_{uij}) - \\lambda_{\\Theta} ||\\Theta||^2 $$\n","\n","where $\\lambda_\\Theta$ are the model specific regularization parameters.\n","\n","\n","### 1.3 Learning with Matrix Factorization\n","\n","#### Stochastic Gradient Descent\n","\n","As the defined objective function is differentiable, gradient descent based method for optimization is naturally adopted.  The gradient of the objective $J$ with respect to the model parameters:\n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{align}\n","\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\Theta} & = \\sum_{(u, i, j) \\in D_S} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\Theta} \\text{ln} \\ \\sigma(\\hat{x}_{uij}) - \\lambda_{\\Theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\Theta} ||\\Theta||^2 \\\\\n","& \\propto \\sum_{(u, i, j) \\in D_S} \\frac{-e^{-\\hat{x}_{uij}}}{1 + e^{-\\hat{x}_{uij}}} \\cdot  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\Theta} \\hat{x}_{uij} - \\lambda_{\\Theta} \\Theta\n","\\end{align}\n","$$\n","\n","Due to slow convergence of full gradient descent, we prefer using stochastic gradient descent to optimize the BPR model.  For each triplet $(u, i, j) \\in D_S$, the update rule for the parameters:\n","\n","$$ \\Theta \\leftarrow \\Theta + \\alpha \\Big( \\frac{e^{-\\hat{x}_{uij}}}{1 + e^{-\\hat{x}_{uij}}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\Theta} \\hat{x}_{uij} + \\lambda_\\Theta \\Theta \\Big) $$\n","\n","#### Matrix Factorization for Preference Approximation\n","\n","As mentioned earlier, the preference scoring function $\\hat{x}_{uij}(\\Theta)$ could be approximated by any real-valued function.  First, the estimator $\\hat{x}_{uij}$ is decomposed into:\n","\n","$$ \\hat{x}_{uij} = \\hat{x}_{ui} - \\hat{x}_{uj} $$\n","\n","The problem of estimating $\\hat{x}_{ui}$ is a standard collaborative filtering formulation, where matrix factorization approach has shown to be very effective.  The prediction formula can written as dot product between user feature vector $w_u$ and item feature vector $h_i$:\n","\n","$$ \\hat{x}_{ui} = \\langle w_u , h_i \\rangle = \\sum_{f=1}^{k} w_{uf} \\cdot h_{if} $$\n","\n","The  derivatives of matrix factorization with respect to the model parameters are:\n","\n","$$\n","\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\hat{x}_{uij} =\n","\\begin{cases}\n","    (h_{if} - h_{jf})  & \\text{if } \\theta = w_{uf} \\\\\n","    w_{uf}             & \\text{if } \\theta = h_{if} \\\\\n","    -w_{uf}            & \\text{if } \\theta = h_{jf} \\\\\n","    0                  & \\text{else}\n","\\end{cases}\n","$$\n","\n","In theory, any kernel can be used to estimate $\\hat{x}_{ui}$ besides the dot product $ \\langle \\cdot , \\cdot \\rangle $.
